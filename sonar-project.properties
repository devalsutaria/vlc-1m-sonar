# Use comma-separated glob patterns

# Important for large projects or specific memory needs for CFamily analyzer
# By default, the CFamily analyzer runs on a single thread.
# You can increase this for faster analysis if your build machine has multiple cores.
# Note: Increasing threads increases memory consumption.
# sonar.cfamily.threads=4 # Example: use 4 threads for analysis
